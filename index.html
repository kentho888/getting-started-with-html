  <p><b>Important Concepts</b></p>

<p><b>How the Web Works</b></p>
<em>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other.</em> When a person goes to a web page like <a href="www.google.com"a> www.google.com</a>, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

<p><b>HTML</b></p>
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. <em>HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web.</em> HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks".

<p><b>Tags and Elements</b></p>
HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.

<p><b>Why Computers are Stupid</b></p>
<em>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally.</em> This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

<p><b>Inline vs Block Elements</b></p>
HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
